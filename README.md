# Investment App

This application is an investment portfolio app built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Flask is a python-based backend that is used to create web apps. I chose this framework because of its ease of use and flexibility. 

This project is based on both the Flask tutorial and a past project that was completed for CS50X.

You can find the Flask documentation here: 

And the github repository for my CS50 Finance project can be found here:
