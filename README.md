# Investment App

This application is an investment portfolio app built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

This project is based on both the Flask tutorial and a past project that was completed for CS50X. You can find more info on the CS50 course here: cs50.harvard.edu

Flask is a python-based backend that is used to quickly create scalable web apps. I chose to stick with this framework because of its ease of use and flexibility.



You can find the Flask documentation here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/
